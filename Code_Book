The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals. Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm . Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing to indicate frequency domain signals. 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.


Qualatative Data:

subject - identification number of volenteer
          Levels: 1 to 30
          
  
Activity - task performed by volenteer

          Levels: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING


Partition - The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly             partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30%             the test data.

          Levels: Train, Test
          
Quanititative Data:  (x, y, z coordinates) / mean(): Mean value and std(): Standard deviation of the following:
